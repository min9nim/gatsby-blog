서버로 요청을 수행할 때 XHR객체의 readyState, status 상태값의 변화는 다음과 같다

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ZMxZzz" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="min9nim" data-pen-title="xhr-state" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/min9nim/pen/ZMxZzz/">xhr-state</a> by Song, MinGu (<a href="https://codepen.io/min9nim">@min9nim</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

readyState 값을 통해 요청의 진행 단계를 확인할 수 있다

Value	| State	| Description
--- | --- | ---
0 | 	UNSENT	| Client has been created. open() not called yet.
1	| OPENED	| open() has been called.
2	| HEADERS_RECEIVED	| send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
3	| LOADING	| Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
4	| DONE	| The operation is complete.
